# github-is-evil
Switched off of github in favor of privacy, security, full features. Commandline git!

Since the purchase of github by Microsoft, a lot of sentiment went against github. While I personally agree with the sentiment, the main reasons for migration include ownership of data, being able to set rights to repositories, functionality not included with github, not wanting to "upgrade" to enterprise edition to get otherwise free features, and many more. 

Github is a social media platform for developers at this point, and I am pulling back from social media after doing some Big Data analysis. Why give them your data, so they can sell it? I don't see the value in turning over my data or metadata.
